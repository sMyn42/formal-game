# formal-game

Repo to implement aspects of General Game Playing, and ensure consistency of probability.

This iteration of the project is concerned with creating a framework to express a probabilistic and time-bound GGP approach, and formalize it in the form of a basketball game.

The file gdl_three.py should contain the sum total of new constructs and old part of the GDL translated for simplicity into Python (using Python's interpreter as a workaround for a time shortage), and the notebook basketball.py should have everything needed for a singel trial run of constructing a basketball game.

```tictactoe.py``` showcases a 

```gdl_three.py``` is the base code to be able to run the basketball simulation based on PyMC

```basketball.ipynb``` uses the contents of ```gdl_three.py``` to build a basketball game that satisfies the requirements of both GDLs and enables Bayesian inference in the game tree.
