# formal-game

Repo to implement aspects of General Game Playing, and ensure consistency of probability.

This iteration of the project is concerned with creating a framework to express a probabilistic and time-bound GGP approach, and formalize it in the form of a basketball game.

The file gdl_three.py should contain the sum total of new constructs and old part of the GDL translated for simplicity into Python (using Python's interpreter as a workaround for a time shortage), and the notebook basketball.py should have everything needed for a singel trial run of constructing a basketball game.

REST IS ON COLAB, IN THE PROCESS OF PORTING
